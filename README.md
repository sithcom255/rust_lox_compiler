### Lox interpreter written in Rust

~~Quite standard~~ implementation of interpreter, written with ~~TDD (hopefully)~~.

This is my attempt to follow guidance of a book in different language. I ended up doing things similarly but worse 
and see the impact of small decisions over time. Great experience, terrible rust/interpreter code.
